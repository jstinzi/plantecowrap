\title{Printing graphs from a list of graphs}
\usage{
print_graphs(data, height = 5, width = 5, res = 600, units = "in")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List of graphs to output as .jpeg files}

\item{height}{Height of output graphs}

\item{width}{Width of output graphs}

\item{res}{Resolution of output graphs}

\item{units}{Units of height and width}
}
\value{
print_graphs creates jpeg files from a list of graphs based on
the graph names. Used in combination with get_t_graphs. Output is a
series of .jpeg files in the working directory.
