\title{Printing graphs from a list of graphs}
\usage{
print_graphs(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List of graphs to output as .jpeg files}
}
\value{
print_graphs creates jpeg files from a list of graphs based on
the graph names. Used in combination with get_t_graphs. Output is a
series of .jpeg files in the working directory.
