\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame with A/Ci curves. Requires net CO2 assimilation
(Anet/Photo/ALEAF in umol m-2 s-1), leaf temperature (Tleaf in Celsius),
intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci, in umol mol-1), incident irradiance
on the leaf (PPFD/PARi in umol m-2 s-1), atmospheric pressure (Patm/Press
in kPa), and (optional, set useRd = TRUE for this option) respiration
(Rd, in umol m-2 s-1).}

\item{group1}{grouping variable 1, could be species, temperature, ID}

\item{group2}{grouping variable 2}

\item{group3}{grouping variable 3}

\item{gm25}{mesophyll conductance at 25 Celsius in mol m-2 s-1 bar-1}

\item{Egm}{activation energy of mesophyll conductance in kJ mol-1}

\item{K25}{Km in 21% O2 (aka Kcair, aka apparent Km in 21% O2) at 25 Celsius
in umol mol-1 (equivalent to ubar bar-1)}

\item{Ek}{activation energy of Kcair in kJ mol-1}

\item{Gstar25}{photorespiratory CO2 compensation point at 25 Celsius in
umol mol-1 (equivalent to ubar bar-1)}

\item{Egamma}{activation energy of GammaStar in kJ mol-1}

\item{fitmethod}{Set to either "bilinear" or "default". Default option
in this package is "default". See ?fitaci in plantecophys for more
details.}

\item{fitTPU}{Should TPU limitations be fit? Set to TRUE/FALSE. See
?fitaci in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{Tcorrect}{Should outputs be temperature corrected? Default here
is FALSE. See ?fitaci in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{useRd}{Should respiration be used? Default is FALSE. See ?fitaci
in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{citransition}{Pre-specify Ci transition point? Units in umol mol-1
(ubar bar-1) Default is FALSE. See ?fitaci in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{alphag}{Fraction of photorespiratory glycolate carbon that is not
returned to the chloroplast (von Caemmerer, 2000). If ACi curves show
high-CO2 decline, then this value should be > 0. See ?fitaci in plantecophys
for more details.}

\item{PPFD}{Light intensity? Can be retrieved from dataframe. Default is
NULL. Units are umol m-2 s-1. See ?fitaci in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{Tleaf}{Leaf temperature? Can be retrieved from dataframe. Default is
NULL. Units are Celsius. See ?fitaci in plantecophys for more details.}

\item{alpha}{Quantum yield of CO2 assimilation. Default is 0.24. Units are
umol CO2 fixed / umol incident photons. See  ?fitaci in plantecophys for
more details.}

\item{theta}{Curvature of the photosynthetic light response. Default is
0.85. If light response has sharper transition, increase up to 1. If light
response has shallower curves, decrease towards 0. See ?fitaci in
plantecophys for more details.}

\item{varnames}{Variable names in your dataframe. ALEAF is net CO2
assimilation in umol m-2 s-1, Tleaf is leaf temperature in Celsius,
Ci is intercellular CO2 concentration in umol mol-1, PPFD is light
intensity in umol m-2 s-1, Rd is respiration rate in umol m-2 s-1,
and Press is atmospheric pressure in kPa. See ?fitaci in plantecophys
for more details.}

\value{
fitacis2 allows gmeso, GammaStar, and Km to vary with Tleaf.
Output matches the fitacis function from plantecophys. Note that the
temperature response function of Km is derived from the temperature
responses of Ko and Kc in Bernacchi et al.2001, as is the GammaStar
temperature response defaults. The gm defaults are from Bernacchi et
al. 2002 fitted between 1and 35 Celsius. Also note that this ALWAYS
uses gm. To fitdata on a "Ci-basis", set gm25 really high (e.g.
10000 mol m-2 s-1 bar-1) and Egm to 0 kJ mol-1.

In some instances (e.g. very low stomatal conductance), fitacis2 will fail.
In these cases, the output for that curve will be "Failed", rather than an
A-Ci curve fit object.
